# Applying a Sepia Filter using C, MPICH, Glade, Gtk and Python.

This project is divided into two parts. 

The first part involves applying a sepia filter to an image using C and MPICH, which is an implementation of the MPI (Message Passing Interface) standard for distributed memory computing.

The second part involves creating a GUI using Glade, a graphical user interface builder for Gtk. We use the Gtk library to load and manipulate the interface from the Python code.

## Requirements

To run this program, you need to have:

- A C compiler (such as mpicc)
- MPICH
- An input image file in png format
- Glade
- Python
- Python PyGObject package

## Usage

First, you need to compile the program using the following command:
`mpicc *.c -lz -lm -o example`

Then, you execute the program using the following command:
`mpiexec -n 8 ./example "yule.png" "yule.out.png"`

Where `<n>` is the number of processes to use. For example, in this case we're using 8 processes; `"yule.png"` is the input image path and `"yule.out.png"` is the output image path.

After doing that, you need to run the GUI using the following command:
`python3 readpng.py`

## How it works

For the first part, the program works as follows:

1. The master process reads the input image file and divides it into equal-sized chunks of rows.
2. Each worker process applies the sepia filter to its chunk.
3. Each worker process sends its filtered chunk back to the master process.
4. The master process merges the filtered chunks and saves the result to the output image file.

The sepia filter algorithm used is saved in the `example.c` file.

For the second part, the program does:
1. Create a GUI using Glade.
2. Create Python code using Gtk library that will do the following:
  - It imports the necessary modules: gi, Gtk, subprocess.
  - It defines a global variable "file_path" to store the path of the file that is selected by the user.
  - It defines a class "Handler" that contains several methods to handle various events such as closing the window, opening a file, and applying an MPI filter.
  - It creates an instance of Gtk.Builder() and loads the UI definition from the `"readpng.glade"` file.
  - It connects the signals in the UI definition to the corresponding methods in the Handler class.
  - It retrieves several objects from the UI definition such as the main window, an image widget, and a dialog window for selecting the number of processors to use for the MPI filter.
  - It shows the main window and starts the Gtk main loop.

## Limitations

- The input image file must be in png format.
- The output image file will also be in png format.

## Example
Here we have the input image on the left and the output image on the right:


<img src="/yule.png" alt="Input image" width="200" height="200"/> <img src="/out.png" alt="Output image" width="200" height="200"/>

This is what the GUI looks like after running the program, before and after applying the filter:

<img src="/gui.png" alt="GUI" width="200" height="300"/> <img src="/gui1.png" alt="GUI" width="200" height="300"/>
